This repo contains a jupyter notebook for classifying the publicly available [Epileptic Patients' Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5pc2j46cbc/1). The dataset was donated to the Mendeley website by American University in Beirut's researcher, [Professor Nasreddine Wassim](https://www.emedevents.com/speaker-profile/wassim-nasreddine). The dataset has four classes:
1. Class 0 which denotes normal, *non-epileptic*, EEG signals
2. Class 1 which denotes EEG signals for *Complex Partial Seizures*
3. Class 2 which denotes EEG signals for *electrographic seizures* 
4. Class 3 which denotes *video-detected seizures* with no visual change over EEG.

For more info about the dataset, please read the accompanying documentation [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5pc2j46cbc/1). There are three steps:
1. Something

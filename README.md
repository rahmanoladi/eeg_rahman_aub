# Introduction
This repo contains a Jupyter notebook for classifying the publicly available [Epileptic Patients' Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5pc2j46cbc/1). The techniques used in the Jupyter notebook successfully achieved a **perfect classification accuracy of 100%** on the training set, while achieving a classification accuracy of **95%** on the test set. The dataset was donated to the Mendeley website by American University in Beirut's researcher, [Professor Nasreddine Wassim](https://www.emedevents.com/speaker-profile/wassim-nasreddine). The dataset has four classes:
1. Class **0** which denotes normal, **non-epileptic**, EEG signals
2. Class **1** which denotes EEG signals for **Complex Partial Seizures**
3. Class **2** which denotes EEG signals for **electrographic seizures** 
4. Class **3** which denotes **video-detected seizures** with no visual change over EEG.

For more info about the dataset, please read the accompanying documentation [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5pc2j46cbc/1). There are three steps:
1. Something
